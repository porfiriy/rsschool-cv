##ABOUT ME##
 I live in Minsk, I am 18 years old and I study at a lyceum. At the moment I am doing an internship at the factory. This is the best motivation for me to learn and develop. Since I was fond of programming from an early age, this contributed to the fact that I study Frontend. 
 I am striving to get into an IT company as a junior developer. I am ready to study constantly and without interruption, because the situation in which I am now gives me even more motivation! 
 Factory is evil!

 MY SKILLS:
*I know the basics of C ++, but I won't lie, at most I can write a calculator or a simple function

*can use git and GitHub

*can use Unreal Engine and make simple games

*I use VS CODE and other development tools
